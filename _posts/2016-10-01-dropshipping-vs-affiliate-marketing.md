## What Is Dropshipping?

Dropshipping is a way to run an online store where you don’t have to store inventory and you don’t have to ship product. The way it works is that you set up your storefront and collect money just like a regular store.

But instead of having to pack and ship the product once you receive an order, you simply place an identical order with the distributor at a wholesale price and the distributor takes care of shipping the product to the end customer for you.

The amount of profit you make is your selling price minus the wholesale price.

The main advantage of dropshipping of course is that you don’t have to manage inventory or product fulfillment. However, since you are selling the product under your own store name, you are still responsible for customer support.

## What Is Affiliate Marketing?

Affiliate marketing is when you refer a customer to another business and take a commission if the customer makes a purchase. In effect, your website acts like a marketing and referral engine and you don’t actually sell any product.

In addition, you don’t directly collect any money either. Once a sale has been made, the affiliate business is responsible for paying you your commission which usually occurs on a monthly basis.

How does the affiliate business know that it was you who referred the customer? A tracking cookie is placed on the customer’s computer whenever they click on a link on your site that takes you to their business.

If the customer makes a purchase and has the cookie installed on their computer, then you get credit for the sale.
